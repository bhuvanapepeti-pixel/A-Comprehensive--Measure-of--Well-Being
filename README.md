🌍 HDI Predictor — Human Development Index Estimator
A production-ready, end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts a country's (or hypothetical region's) Human Development Index (HDI) score and classifies it into a development tier — Very High, High, Medium, or Low — based on three core indicators:

Life Expectancy at Birth
Mean Years of Schooling
GNI Per Capita
Built with a Linear Regression model trained using Scikit-learn and served through a Flask web application with a clean, modern UI.

✨ Features
Clean, responsive web form for entering development indicators
Real-time HDI score prediction using a trained Linear Regression model
Automatic classification into UNDP-style development tiers
Input validation with clear error messaging
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) visuals: correlation heatmap and feature scatter plots
Modern, professional UI (blue/slate/white palette)
Modular, well-documented Python codebase ready for extension

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Extract the project
Unzip the downloaded archive to a folder of your choice, then navigate into it:

cd hdi_predictor
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Train the model
This step loads data/hdi_dataset.csv, performs preprocessing and EDA, trains the Linear Regression model, evaluates it, and saves hdi_model.pkl.

python train_model.py
Expected console output includes the dataset shape, R² score, MAE, RMSE, and model coefficients. Two visualization files will also be created inside static/css/.

5. Run the Flask application
python app.py
The app will start at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/
6. Use the application
Open the URL above in your browser.
Enter values for Life Expectancy, Mean Years of Schooling, and GNI Per Capita.
Click Predict HDI Score.
View the predicted HDI score along with its development category badge.
📊 Model Details
Algorithm: Linear Regression (sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression)
Features: Life_Expectancy, Mean_Years_Schooling, GNI_Per_Capita
Target: HDI_Score
Preprocessing: Mean imputation for any missing numeric values
Evaluation Metrics: R², MAE, RMSE (printed during training)
HDI Classification Thresholds
Category	Score Range
Very High	≥ 0.800
High	0.700 – 0.799
Medium	0.550 – 0.699
Low	< 0.550
🔄 Retraining with New Data
To retrain the model with a larger or updated dataset:

Replace or append rows to data/hdi_dataset.csv, keeping the same column names: Country, Life_Expectancy, Mean_Years_Schooling, GNI_Per_Capita, HDI_Score
Re-run:
python train_model.py
Restart the Flask app to load the newly saved hdi_model.pkl.
🧪 Notes & Limitations
The bundled dataset is a small, illustrative sample (~20 rows) intended for demonstration. For production accuracy, use the full UNDP Human Development Report dataset.
Predictions are clipped to the valid HDI range of [0, 1].
Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between indicators and HDI; consider polynomial or ensemble models for higher fidelity on larger datasets.
